# Work Log

This is the third project in Treehouse Python tech degree.

To use run work_log.py

## Description

Develop a terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. The script should ask for a task name, 
how much time was spent on the task, and any general notes about the task. Record each of these items into a row of a 
CSV file along with a date.

Provide a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or that match a search string 
(either as a regular expression or a plain text search). 
Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, and general notes.

## Extra Credit

Implement a one-time pad to secure the cipher.

A one-time pad is an additional input step 
required prior to enc or decrypt a message. As long
as both the sender and receiver use the same pad,
the message itself becomes secure. Without the pad,
the message cannot be recovered.
