# Notes

- Make a script that runs without errors. Catch
exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.

- As a user of the script, if I choose to enter a new work log,
I should be able to provide a task name, a number of minutes spent
working on it, and any additional notes I want to record

- As a user of the script, if I choose to find a previous entry,
I should be presented with four options:
  - Find by date
  - Find by time spent
  - Find by exact search
  - Find by pattern
